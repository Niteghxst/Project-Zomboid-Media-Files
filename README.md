# Project Zomboid Media Files
This repository holds all files that are contained within the "media" folder within Project Zomboid's folder structure, to allow all-time access from anywhere and everywhere by modders who need the files.
# Licensing & Right of Use Statement
I do NOT own nor have created any of the files within this repository except for this readme.md file. Everything else is owned and licensed by [Project Zomboid](https://projectzomboid.com/blog/)'s developer, [The Indie Stone](https://projectzomboid.com/blog/about-us/). I have taken the liberty of grabbing the media files used by modders from my own installation's folder and thrown them in this repository, so that modders around the world with access to Github are able to grab the files on a whim when they don't have the files/game installed on their system. 

I personally do not see a problem with doing this as anyone could easily access these files by buying a copy, but I can understand it if the developers would want to take this down as it is still something from out of the game files themselves. Therefor the following statement: _**I have not asked permission of the developing company, so if this is against the developer's rights etc. to put these files in a public repository, this will be taken down accordingly on their request! To contact me, I am in the [Project Zomboid Discord Server](https://discord.gg/theindiestone), same name as here, so feel free to DM or @ me in the server in case it has to be taken down.**_ üôè
# To My Fellow Modders
I hope you all can make great use out of this. Keep in mind these are **ALMOST** all media files, and the total size of everything combined is **+1 GB**, so my tip is to download files as you need them in case you either miss something or quickly want to download _one of the the files / a set of files_. üòÑ 

I had to omit some folders as the files within exceeded **Github's Max File Upload Size Limit**, being:
- maps
- sound
- texturepacks

So if you need any of those files, I'll gladly send you those directly through Discord or WeTransfer as a .zip file
